Thank you so much for taking interests in `MySchedule` project!

I am currently the main developer on this project. I've been blessed to have a full time job that brings enough income for my family, and so I am in no dire need of financial support at this time. I am giving away my time and effort in this project for sake of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, because He asked me to be the salt and light for the people around me and to this world.

If you're so inclined to give however, you may try donating to   [Gifts of Compassion](http://www.compassion.com/catalog.htm).

I am very thankful you're taking interests in my work and my passion. You can always drop me a note on what you think, and I will surely to read it.

Sincerely,

Zemian Deng
